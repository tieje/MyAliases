# MyAliases
Aliases that I use on systems. Run the `setup-aliases.sh` file when you need to setup aliases on unix systems.

Commands for appending shebang lines and `chmod u+x` to all files in the current directory for Holberton projects:

- `shebangs`
- `bangs`
- `pybangs`
- `jsbangs`

Windows will be configured if I need it.
